# CS6515 Graduate Algorithms
### Dynamic Programming
- Typical DP problems: longest increasing subsequence, longest common subsequence, knapsack, and chain matrix multiplication.
- Graph algorithms (shortest path for direct graph): dijkstra, bellman-ford, floyd-warshall
### Divide and Conquer
- Fast Integer Multiplication
- Median (with linear time)
- Fast Fourier Transform (finding coefficient for polynomial multiplication)
